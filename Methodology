# Testing Methodology for Culpeo #


# Basic Setup #

* Use "synthetic harvested energy circuit"-- a buck regulator on a PCB powered
by 3.3V from the control MCU launchpad to output ~2.1V across a 1k resistor
for a trickle charge effect.

* Put a relay between between the charging circuit and the P_in pin on the power
system.

* Re-route V_out from the output booster to the scary PCB with all of the
Resistor-Transistor circuits.

* TODO: thorough description of the Frankenstein-ing that happened

# Test Capacitor Bank ESR #

These tests are run by hand using the electronic load (BK Precision 9600
electronic load) and they determine the capacitor bank's ESR over a range of
frequencies.  You use the BK to generate a [load] pulse train that the capacitor
bank will handle.

* Turn on the saleae, drop the config down so only the analog V_cap line is
being measured using 125e3 samples/sec. Set it up to measure for 35 seconds, no
Trigger

* Disconnect the control MCU from the enable pin on the power system

* Connect the +/- leads from the BK to V_cap and ground.

* Compile the control MCU code with the no flags. This will ensure that
the control MCU will only charge up when you press the button.

`make clean; make all `

* Configure in the BK external trigger source. Page 44 of the
 [manual](https://bkpmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/manuals/en-us/8600_Series_manual.pdf)

* Set up the BK for Transient operation. Follow the manual's instructions
starting on page 51 (65 of the pdf) of the manual, and hit the trigger so it's
just ticking in the backgroun.  We're going for continuous mode on the following
load settings:

Level A (mA), Level B (mA), frequency (Hz), duty cycle (%), [seconds on]
1, 5, 0.1, 90, [1]
1, 10, 0.1, 90, [1]
1, 25, 0.1, 90, [1]
1, 5, 0.1, 99, [.1]
1, 10, 0.1, 99, [.1]
1, 25, 0.1, 99, [.1]
1, 50, 0.1, 99, [.1]
1, 5, 0.1, 99.9, [.01]
1, 10, 0.1, 99.9, [.01]
1, 25, 0.1, 99.9, [.01]
1, 50, 0.1, 99.9, [.01]
1, 10, 0.1, 99.99, [.001]
1, 25, 0.1, 99.99, [.001]
1, 50, 0.1, 99.99, [.001]

* For each pulse setting, let the control MCU charge up the capacitor bank, then
start the saleae and hit "On/Off" to get the load started.  Once the saleae is
finished measuring (or the capacitor voltage is clearly too low and it's
bottoming out), hit "On/Off" again to turn off the load. Export the whole saleae
trace as a csv with the following naming convention:

`vcap_<level A>--<level B>mA_10s_<duty cycle*>_duty_cycle_<repeat>.csv`

For example: `vcap_1--25mA_10s_99-9_duty_cycle_0.csv`

*use - instead of . to get to decimal places

* Each run will grab 3 or 4 discharges, so you only need to run each test once
